# Altostra for Visual Studio Code

The [Altostra](https://www.altostra.com) extension makes it easy to build and deliver cloud applications
directly from Visual Studio Code. It provides a drag-and-drop interface
alongside the code that simplifies building cloud services to enable any
developer the freedom to design and deploy locally.
